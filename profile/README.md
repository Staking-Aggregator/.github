# StakeBoost
![Alt text](https://github.com/Staking-Aggregator/.github/blob/main/Screenshot%202023-06-10%20at%2002.09.21.jpeg)

  

## Project Description
StakeBoost is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum that provides users with an overview of available Ethereum staking providers and allows them to stake their assets with these providers. In addition, StakeBoost offers the unique feature of boosting staking rewards by adding liquidity to a specially configured Boosted Pool on Balancer. This additional liquidity provides extra yield on the staked assets through fees generated by the pool and by lending out unused liquidity on AAVE.
## Inspiration

The inspiration behind StakeBoost stems from the growing popularity and potential of Ethereum staking. With the introduction of unstaking on Ethereum, it has become evident that Ethereum will continue to thrive and increase in value as a DeFi asset, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Recognizing the increasing demand for staking and the need for tools to optimize the staking experience, StakeBoost aims to empower investors to make the most of these new possibilities.
StakeBoost was developed specifically for the Chainlink 2023 Spring Hackathon. Leveraging the power of Chainlink's oracle network and decentralized infrastructure, we incorporated Chainlink's reliable and secure data feeds into StakeBoost to enhance the functionality and accuracy of our platform.

By integrating Chainlink, we were able to provide real-time and verifiable data on staking providers, token prices, and other essential information. This integration adds an extra layer of trust and transparency to StakeBoost, ensuring that users have access to reliable and up-to-date data when making staking decisions.

Chainlink's robust ecosystem and developer-friendly tools allowed us to seamlessly integrate their oracle services into StakeBoost, enhancing the overall user experience and the reliability of our platform. We are proud to have built StakeBoost with Chainlink and to have participated in the Chainlink 2023 Spring Hackathon.

## What it does

StakeBoost offers users a user-friendly interface that displays an overview of available Ethereum staking providers. Users can select their preferred provider and stake their assets accordingly. For users who already own liquid staking tokens (LSTs) on Ethereum, StakeBoost introduces the concept of boosting staking rewards. By adding their LST as liquidity to the specially configured Boosted Pool on Balancer, users can enhance their staking rewards through two mechanisms:

   1. Balancer provides a share of the pool's fees to everyone who contributes liquidity.
   2. Unused liquidity within the pool is lent out on AAVE, generating additional yield.

It's important to note that all operations within StakeBoost are non-custodial, meaning the user retains full control of their public keys throughout the process. All transactions are executed directly on the Ethereum blockchain at the smart contract level.
How we built it

Building StakeBoost presented several challenges, particularly due to the unavailability of certain features and functions on the same testnets. We initially started development on Goerli, then switched to Sepolia, followed by Polygon Mumbai, and ultimately performed most of the live transactions on Arbitrum. Adapting to different testnets and ensuring seamless integration across them was a significant technical hurdle we had to overcome.
### Smart Contract Layer

The dApp is based on [@openzeppelin/contracts], which is able to take the metadata and convert it into NFTs. As such, the smart contract will be minting ERC-721 tokens using an ERC-721 contract.

  
#### Smart Contracts Addresses

The application utilises the following  smart contracts, at the following addresse:

- Lido (stETH): (0x7e91BE4bd5A02BBc419D4CAAbb4e05ba09aA36FB)
- Lido smart contract: (0xDBE0D9FCFaBa09Af919AF469194F20dC2B4b70c8)
- Rocketpool rETH: (0x67f8aFBA724ABeb1aDCf48DFF5A5b853882E5377)
- Rocketpool smart contract: (0x8C29Ad43A5C0b0A33D133e0c0488252d21b0AA7b)

## Local Setup
Project was built and tested against:
* Node v19.7.0
* Npm v9.5.0

* **Ensure dotenv is setup with team 4 keys/signers** 

#### Smart Contracts
1. From the repo root run ``npm install``
2. Once install is complete:
	 * To **compile** the contract(s) run: 
	 ``npx hardhat compile``
	 * To **test** the contract(s) run: 
	 ``npx hardhat --network hardhat test``
	 * To **run** contracts run: 
	 ``npx hardhat --network hardhat run scripts/deployHashHive.js``

	
#### **Frontend:**
 - Cd to the **frontend** directory.
 - Run ``npm install``
 - Once install is complete:
	 * To start, run: 
	 ``npm run start``
- App will be accessible via http://localhost:3000/
